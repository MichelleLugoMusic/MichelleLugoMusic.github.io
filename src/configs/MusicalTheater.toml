I have made a musical, called Bathroom Breakup, of just three songs
about two girls on elementary school fighting over a boy. On the
first song, she enters the bathroom, and goes through her TikTok
only to see her ex making a new TikTok with another girl, which is
his new girlfriend. She starts singing of the shock.

In the second song, she enters the bathroom and they start fighting
about him.

In the third song, another girl enters the bathroom and tells them
to not fight over a boy, that there are more important things out
there than fight for a boy. And the story ends there.
